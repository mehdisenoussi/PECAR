## Welcome to the PECAR repository.

This is a set of MATLAB functions to perform the analysis on the PECAR experiment dataset. (Senoussi, Moreland, Busch & Dugu√© - 2018 (Submitted))

To perform the analysis you need to download the MGL toolbox which we used to design the experiment and from which some codes are needed to "unpack" the data:
[MGL-toolbox](http://gru.stanford.edu/doku.php/mgl/download)

You should then download or clone the scripts from this github repository as well as the data from this OpenScienceFramework repository: [data](https://osf.io/2d9sc/?view_only=658a434a48c04ba590cdf1a540cf30dd)

You should place the mgl-master folder as well as the uncompressed "data_pecar" folder in the same directory as the scripts.

Finally you can run the scripts in that order to reproduce the figures from the paper:
## THE SCRIPT ARE NOT UPDATED WITH THE LATEST VERSION OF OUR ANALYSIS AS OF THE 15th OF MARCH. THEY WILL BE BY THE 17TH OF MARCH. IF YOU WANT TO CHECK OUT OUR SCRIPTS PLEASE COME BACK THEN.

Thank you for your interest!
